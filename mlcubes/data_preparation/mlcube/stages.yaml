  comment: >
    Please inspect the baseline segmentations at the indicated labels path.
    If using the monitoring tool, you may package cases for review by pressing the 'Package cases for review' button under SUMMARY.
    This will create a tarball file on the working directory (displayed on the monitoring tool header), containing all the cases for review.
    You may untar the segmentation with the following command


    ```
    tar -xzf review_cases.tar.gz
    ```


    If working remotely, move the tarball file to your local machine. Untar the tarball file, select the best baseline segmentation and make any necessary corrections. Once you're done, move the finalized file to the `finalized` folder, retaining the original name.


    If using the monitoring tool, create a new tarball with the previously untarred files, as well as finalized cases. You can do so with the following command


    ```
    tar -czf reviewed_cases.tar.gz -C review_cases .
    ```


    Place this new tarball file on the directory the monitoring tool is running (displayed on the monitoring tool header). The tool will automatically detect the finalized cases and place them in the expected locations.

  comment: The annotation seems to be a copy of a baseline segmentation, please ensure this is intended. Waiting on all cases to be reviewed in order to proceed.

  status_name: ANNOTATION_COMPARISON_FAILED
  comment: The original segmentation for the reviewed file was not identified. This most probably means the annotation file was renamed. Please ensure the reviewed file retains its original name.
