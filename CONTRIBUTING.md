# Contribution Guidelines

FeTS is a package that is primarily worked on by the CBICA Software Development team and Intel, along with their collaborators - additional members from the community are welcome!

## Issues

The easiest way to contribute is by reporting issues is through the [GitHub](https://github.com/FETS-AI/Front-End/issues). 
When reporting an issue, please ensure you fill out as much information from the templates as possible for us to debug and diagnose it.

## Feature Requests

If you have a particular feature in mind, please submit it via the new Feature Request system via [GitHub](https://github.com/FETS-AI/Front-End/issues). 

Depending on our bandwidth, one of the team members will get around to it (we will always respond ASAP).

## Details

Please feel free to email us at software@cbica.upenn.edu, where we will be more than happy to answer any and all questions.
