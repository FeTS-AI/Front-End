##  Existing Connections 

### OpenFL
FeTS leverages the [Open Federated Learning library (OpenFL)](https://github.com/securefederatedai/openfl) for enabling federated machine learning of models.

### GaNDLF
FeTS leverages the [Generally Nuanced Deep Learning Framework (GaNDLF)](https://gandlf.org/) for enabling advanced preprocessing and deep learing based training.

### CaPTk
FeTS leverages the [Cancer Imaging Phenomics Toolkit (CaPTk)](https://www.med.upenn.edu/cbica/captk) for integrating CaPTk's current functionality into FeTS. 

### DCMTK
FeTS uses [DCMTK - DICOM ToolKit (DCMTK)](https://dicom.offis.de/dcmtk.php.en) for DICOM file handling. 

### DCMQI
FeTS leverages [DICOM for Quantitative Imaging (DCMQI)](http://qiicr.org/dcmqi-guide/tutorials/intro.html) for generating DICOM-Seg files from NIfTI files.

### Synapse PACS
FeTS' performance evaluation metrics are used by [Synapse PACS](https://www.synapse.org/).  

### TCIA and IDC
Enriching [The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)](https://www.cancerimagingarchive.net/) and [Imaging Data Commons (IDC)](https://datacommons.cancer.gov/repository/imaging-data-commons) data collections with segmentations and radiomic features. Robustness analysis on radiomic features on TCIA data has also been posted back to TCIA.

## Ongoing Development

### XNAT
Use FeTS' federated learning functionality for data discovery through [XNAT](https://xnat.org) features through its feature extraction functionality. 

### FLAIM
Interoperability and privacy preservation algorithmic comparison. 

### PRISM
Federated learning for segmentation of PRISM data.
