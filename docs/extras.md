# More Information

## The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) and Open Federated Learning (OpenFL)

To enable distributed testing and training machine learning models without direct access to collaborator data, FeTS uses a technique called Federated Learning. The [Open Federated Learning (OpenFL) framework](https://github.com/IntelLabs/OpenFederatedLearning) is developed as part of a collaboration between Intel and the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), as a part of Intelâ€™s commitment in supporting the grant awarded to the [Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics](https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/) at UPenn (PI: S.Bakas) from the [Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR)](https://itcr.cancer.gov/) program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), for the development of the [Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS, www.fets.ai) platform](https://www.fets.ai/) (grant award number: U01-CA242871).
