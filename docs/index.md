# FeTS: Federated Tumor Segmentation 

The Federated Tumor Segmentation (FeTS) platform, describes an on-going under development open-source toolkit, with a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI), aiming at:

- bringing pre-trained segmentation models of numerous deep learning algorithms and their fusion, closer to clinical experts and researchers, thereby enabling easy quantification of new radiographic scans and comparative evaluation of new algorithms.
- allowing secure multi-institutional collaborations via federated learning to improve these pre-trained models without sharing patient data, thereby overcoming legal, privacy, and data-ownership challenges.

Successful completion of this project will lead to an easy-to-use potentially-translatable tool enabling easy, fast, objective, repeatable and accurate tumor segmentation, without requiring a computational background by the user, and while facilitating further analysis of tumor radio-phenotypes towards accelerating discovery. 

FeTS is developed and maintained by the [Center for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics (CBICA)](https://www.cbica.upenn.edu/) at the University of Pennsylvania, in collaboration with [Intel Labs](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/overview.html), [Intel AI](https://www.intel.com/ai), and [Intel Internet of Things Group](https://www.intel.com/iot
).

	abstract={Objective: De-centralized data analysis becomes an increasingly preferred option in the healthcare domain, as it alleviates the need for sharing primary patient data across collaborating institutions. This highlights the need for consistent harmonized data curation, pre-processing, and identification of regions of interest based on uniform criteria. Approach: Towards this end, this manuscript describes the \textbf{Fe}derated \textbf{T}umor \textbf{S}egmentation (FeTS) tool, in terms of software architecture and functionality. Main Results: The primary aim of the FeTS tool is to facilitate this harmonized processing and the generation of gold standard reference labels for tumor sub-compartments on brain magnetic resonance imaging, and further enable federated training of a tumor sub-compartment delineation model across numerous sites distributed across the globe, without the need to share patient data. Significance: Building upon existing open-source tools such as the Insight Toolkit (ITK) and Qt, the FeTS tool is designed to enable training deep learning models targeting tumor delineation in either centralized or federated settings. The target audience of the FeTS tool is primarily the computational researcher interested in developing federated learning models, and interested in joining a global federation towards this effort. The tool is open sourced at https://github.com/FETS-AI/Front-End.}
